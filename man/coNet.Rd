\title{Co-occurrence based interaction network modeling.}
\usage{
coNet(x = "co-occurrence matrix", ci.p = 95, conditional = TRUE,
  scale = FALSE, signs = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A co-occurrence matrix with observations in rows and
species in columns.}

\item{ci.p}{Confidence interval probability used for edge removal
in percent (e.g. use 95 for a nintey-five percent confidence
interval)}

\item{conditional}{LOGICAL: should conditional probabilities be used?}

\item{scale}{LOGICAL: should values be rescaled such that the
number of co-occurrences is divided by the total number of species?}

\item{signs}{LOGICAL: should the sign (positive or negative)
of the interactions be returned?}
}
\value{
An interaction network model in matrix form.
}
\description{
Generates an interaction network model based on a matrix of co-occurrences.
