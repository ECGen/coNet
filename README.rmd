# coNet: Tools for modeling and analyzing ecological networks using co-occurrence data.

# Overview

* Network models are one way to represent systems [@Borrett2014].
* It's not always possible to directly observe relationships
  (i.e. ecological interactions) [@Cite].
* In ecology, space can be used as a substitute for time [@Gotelli],
  making the assumption that variance of conditions and processes have
  little influence on spatial patterns [@Cite].
* This method implements an adaptation of the method developed by
  Araujo et al. 2011 expanded with the application of Bayesian
  probability to generate network models.
* The package also provides functions for comparative analysis of a
  set of networks.

# Install

Currently, the package is still in beta but it can be installed via
the *devtools* package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ECGen/coNet")
```
