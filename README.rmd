* Network models are a useful representation of systems [@Woodward2010].
* Because it is not always possible to directly observe relationships
  (i.e. ecological interactions) spatial or temporal patterns of
  co-occurrence can be used to render models of interaction networks
  [@Araujo2011].
* The *conetto* implements an adaptation of the method developed by
  Araujo et al. 2011 expanded with the application of Bayesian
  probability to generate network models and provides several
  functions useful for comparative analysis of sets of co-occurrence
  based networks. 

# Install

Currently, the package is still in beta but it can be installed via
the *devtools* package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ECGen/coNet")
```
