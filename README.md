-   Network models are a useful representatio of systems
    inter-related compnents (Woodward et
    al. 2010).
-   It's not always possible to directly observe relationships (i.e.
    ecological interactions) (Woodward et al. 2010).
-   In ecology, space can be used as a substitute for time (Araújo et
    al. 2011), making the assumption that variance of conditions and
    processes have little influence on spatial patterns (Araújo et
    al. 2011).
-   This method implements an adaptation of the method developed by
    Araujo et al. 2011 expanded with the application of Bayesian
    probability to generate network models.
-   The package also provides functions for comparative analysis of a
    set of networks.

Install

Currently, the package is still in beta but it can be installed via the
*devtools* package.

    install.packages("devtools")
