# conetto

A toolbox for co-occurrence based network modeling 

Network models are a useful representation of systems
[@Woodward2010]. Because it is not always possible to directly observe
relationships (i.e. ecological interactions) spatial or temporal
patterns of co-occurrence can be used to render models of interaction
networks [@Araujo2011]. *conetto* adapts a method previously developed
for ecological networks [@Araujo2011] with the application of Bayesian
probability to generate network models and provides several functions
useful for comparative analysis of sets of co-occurrence based
networks.

# Installation

Currently, the package is still in beta but it can be installed via
the *devtools* package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ECGen/coNet")
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(conetto)
```

# How to use the package


The basic usage of the *conetto* package is to generate network
models. To do this, we need a matrix of co-occurrence values, which
will be passed into the `coNet` function:

```{r}
A <- c(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
B <- c(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
C <- c(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)
D <- c(0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)
M <- data.frame(A, B, C, D)
coNet(M)
```

The `coNet` function returns of square matrix with the same number of
rows and columns equal to the number of columns in the co-occurrence
matrix. There are a couple of features that are useful to note here:

* First, the matrix is not symmetric, that is, the top and bottom
  halves are not equal. This is because the dependency of two
  variables is based on both their independent occurrences and their
  co-occurrences: $P(A|B) = P(A,B)/P(B)$ and $P(B|A) =
  P(A,B)/P(A)$. 
* Some of the values in the network are zero. This is because
  `coNet` conducts a test that compares the observed co-occurrences to
  a theoretical "null" co-occurrence interval. If the observed
  co-occurrences are within the interval, the conditional probability
  is set equal to the joint probability. Then, when relativized, the
  resulting values are zero (i.e. $P(A,B) - P(A,B) = 0$). The
  threshold for the null interval test can be adjusted using the
  *ci.p* argument (DEFAULT = 95).
* Also, some values are negative. This is because the network is
  comprised of the difference between the interval adjusted
  conditional probabilities and the observed independent probabilities
  (i.e. $P(A|B) - P(A)$). The "raw", un-relativized, values can be
  returned via the *raw* argument.


## Network comparisons

The `coNet` function was developed for use with replicated datasets,
where multiple networks have been observed. Two other functions were
written to provide a way to analyze these network sets.

One function, `meanNet`, will calculate the "mean" or average of a set
of networks. The result is the cell-wise summation of all matrices
divided by the total number of matrices. This function requires that
the set of networks all have the same dimensionality and that they are
organized into a list.

```{r}
net.l <- lapply(1:3, function(x) matrix(runif(9), nrow = 3))
net.l
meanNet(net.l)
```

Another function, `distNet`, facilitates the calculation of a distance
matrix for a set of networks. Two metrics are provided, Euclidean and
Bray-Curtis. The resulting matrix is the distance among all networks
in the set. Similar to `meanNet`, `distNet` requires that all matrices
have the same dimensionality. The result is a distance, or
dissimilarity in the case of Bray-Curtis, matrix that can now be used
for multivariate analyses, such as ordination.

```{r}
net.d <- distNet(net.l)
net.d
```

# Method: Co-occurrence based network models

The network modeling is based on conditional probability. Ultimately,
we are interested in an estimate of how much one variable (A) affects
another (B), and visa-versa. *conetto* approaches this by calculating
the difference between the conditional and independent probabilities
of species paris using the observed occurrences ($A$ and $B$) and
co-occurrences ($A,B$) of the variables of interest from a set of
observations ($N$). 

* Independent probabilities ($P(A) = A/N$ and $P(B) = B/N$) 
* Joint probabilities $P(A,B) = (A,B) / N$
* Conditional probabilities $P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / P(B)$

Since there is uuncertainly in whether or not two species are
dependent, *conetto* uses a interval based test to determine whether
or not to use the observed joint probability $O[P(A,B)] = (A,B)/N$ or
the expected probability using an analytical null model $E[P(A,B)] =
P(A)P(B)$. Via the Chain Rule of probabililty $P(A,B) = P(B|A)P(A)$,
such that if $E[P(A,B)]$ is used then $P(A|B) = P(A)P(B) / P(B)$,
which reduces to $P(A|B) = P(A)$ and A is conditionally independent
from B. We can then subtract the independent probability matrix from
the interval test modified conditional probability matrix, which
produces a matrix of the dependency among the variables of interest.
